# Flicks

## Basics
A flick (frame-tick) is a very small unit of time. It is 1/705600000 of a second, exactly.

    1 flick = 1/705600000 second

This unit of time is the smallest time unit which is LARGER than a nanosecond,
and can in integer quantities exactly represent a single frame duration for
24 Hz, 25 Hz, 30 Hz, 48 Hz, 50 Hz, 60 Hz, 90 Hz, 100 Hz, 120 Hz, and also 1/1000 divisions of each, 
as well as a single sample duration for 8 kHz, 16 kHz, 22.05 kHz, 24 kHz, 32 kHz, 44.1 kHz, 
48 kHz, 88.2 kHz, 96 kHz, and 192kHz, as well as the NTSC frame durations for
24 * (1000/1001) Hz, 30 * (1000/1001) Hz, 60 * (1000/1001) Hz, and 120 * (1000/1001) Hz.

That above was one hell of a run-on sentence, but it's strictly and completely correct in its 
description of the unit.

This makes flicks suitable for use via std::chrono::duration and std::ratio for doing timing work
against the system high resolution clock, which is in nanoseconds, but doesn't get slightly
out of sync when doing common frame rates.
 
We also support some common audio sample rates as well. This list is not exhaustive, but covers 
the majority of digital audio formats. They are 8kHz, 16kHz, 22.05kHz, 24kHz, 32kHz, 44.1kHz, 
48kHz, 88.2kHz, 96kHz, and 192kHz.

Though it is not part of the design criteria, 144 Hz, which some newer monitors refresh at,
does work correctly with flicks.

NTSC IS NOT EXPLICITLY SUPPORTED IN ALL OF ITS SUBTLE NUANCES, BUT:
The NTSC variations (~23.976, ~29.97, etc) are approximately defined as 24 * 1000/1001 and
30 * 1000/1001, etc. These can be represented exactly in flicks, but 1/1000 divisions are not
available. 

Many folks online have pointed out that NTSC technically has a variable frame rate,
and that this is handled correctly in other media playback libraries such as QuickTime. 
The goal of flicks is to provide a simple, convenient std::chrono::duration to work
with when writing code that works with simulation and time in media, but not explicitly to 
handle complex variable-rate playback scenarios. So we'll stick with the 1000/1001 approximations, 
and leave it at that!

## Motivation

When working creating visual effects for film, television, and other media, it is common
to run simulations or other time-integrating processes which subdivide a single frame of time
into a fixed, integer number of subdivisions. It is handy to be able to accumulate these 
subdivisions to create exact 1-frame and 1-second intervals, for a variety of reasons. 

Knowing that you should never, ever use floating point representations for accumulated, 
simulated time (lest your temporal accuracy degrade over time), the std::chrono time tools
in C++ are ideal. However, the highest usable resolution, nanoseconds, doesn't evenly divide
common film & media framerates. This was the genesis of this unit.

## Acknowledgements

This time unit began as a technical question posted publicly on Facebook by Christopher Horvath
in late 2016. Many people contributed and refined the unit, including Dan Goldman, Pascal Pincosy,
Simon Eves, Kearsley Higgins, Francisco De La Torre, Benjy Feen, Eric Landreneau and Sebastian Sylwan,
among others. Here's the post!

## Installation
Just place flicks.h wherever you install C++ header files - this is a header only library. Flicks are placed
in the "util" namespace here, for lack of a clear alternative. It would be nice if they were in std:: someday.

Note that you can just skip all of that and put this directly into your code. 

```

#include <chrono>
#include <ratio>
using flicks = std::chrono::duration<std::chrono::nanoseconds::rep, std::ratio<1, 705600000>>;

```

That's right! The entire library is technically just one line of code, if you don't worry about a 
few convenience functions.

## Derivation
A C++ file which implements a derivation of flicks is provided - it is not required to use the library,
but only to show how it was derived. A brute-force approach was intentionally used. To compile, assuming
you have a C++ compiler installed, just do this:

    > c++ -o flicks_derivation flicks_derivation.cpp -std=c++14; ./flicks_derivation

## Test
A C++ file which tests flicks is provided - it is not required to use the library,
but only to test the unit. To compile, assuming you have a C++ compiler installed, just do this:

    > c++ -o flicks_test flicks_test.cpp -std=c++14; ./flicks_test

## Motivating example
A C++ file demonstrating a simplified version of the production case in which we first encountered
this problem is provided. It shows first a failure case, and then a fixed example using flicks. It
is implemented using plain integers for illustration purposes.

    > c++ -o flicks_motivation flicks_motivation.cpp -std=c++14; ./flicks_motivation

## Makefile
A makefile is provided that works on a Linux-y system or OSX, but not Windows. To use it:

    > make

To clean up:

    > make clean

## Previous Work

In a previous work lead by Sorbonne University and the French National Institute of Audiovisual, 
TimeRefs were defined as 1/14112000s, giving 1 TimeRef=50 Flicks.
